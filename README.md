# SAVE THE PANGOLIN

[Live Demo Here] https://wdi-sg.github.io/wdi-project-1-lackdaz/

This is my modest recreation of the Google Chromium T-rex game. It is essentially an endless runner with a Pangolin as the avatar! I thought it would be cool to raise awareness about cool-and-not-yet-extinct endangered wildlife - and deliberately made the game impossible in the end to symbolize the Herculean nature of Pangolin's fight for survival.

I initially wanted to feature the combined cataclysmic human threats of electric fences, concrete mixers, drones and humans-with-selfie-sticks (yeap, they are way more dangerous than poachers). Too bad my coding skills suck.

## Gameplay

** 1 PLAYER
(SAME KEYS)

DOWN - DUCK

## Development
* HTML5 Canvas, programmed using JavaScript
* Skeleton CSS Framework
* A modest attempt at trying to make it fit on all browsers
* index.html / style.css / script.js
* [View Code Workflow here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7KCB1ruE53gM1Q3YVlnY0o2Vlk/view?usp=sharing/)

## What I would've done differently
* I would have liked to use constructors very differently, using of some the sample code boxed in my options when I wanted to develop the game further (more levels, more obstacles). Couldn't wrap my head around constructors well!
* Even though the use of singletons for images helped when referencing certain properties of images, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to retrieve them for use in canvas drawing.
* Add trailing obstacle movement towards the player
* I eventually found the assets to the actual game(too late for this submission), should have researched more - had to do a lot of reinventing of the wheel.
* Randomized Terrain Generation
