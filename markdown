Speed up by eating oranges along the way, but avoid the firecrackers or you'll be back where you first started, and a lot poorer! Collect more money than your opponent within 30 seconds to win!

## Development
* HTML5 Canvas, programmed using JavaScript
* Skeleton CSS Framework
* A bit of Responsive Web Design to have everything fit onscreen regardless of browser size
* index.html / style.css / script.js
* [View Code Workflow here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uzdkDOVF2_yVdmQA22r5RG9DANF_smVhi5z-qyL131I/edit?usp=sharing)

## What I would've done differently
* Declare `keysDown` as an array instead of an object
* CSS styling could’ve been improved to make it more responsive to the user’s screen - Could have rearranged divs entirely upon hitting a minimum screen size
* I would do `renderObjs()` very differently. The plan was to use different sprite images for the players when moving in different directions. Need to improve my understanding of Canvas!
* Add obstacles to restrict movement on the game board
